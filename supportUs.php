					<p>For 2015 we have a ‘Friends of the Festival’ scheme whereby businesses and individuals can contribute 
					   to the running cost of the festival. We ask for donations of €50 and for this their names are included in the programme 
					   and also on the website and they will receive regular updates on festival news and an invite to the Festival Launch.<br><br>
					   You can do this now by emailing us at: info@midletonmidmayfestival.ie or by Phone: 086 0597798<br><br>
                       Here is a list of Friends for the 2014 festival. We are extremely grateful for their generosity!</p>
